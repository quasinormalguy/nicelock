- TODO: [[https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/capscolor][capscolor]] patch is causing seg fault, find a workaround

*** How-to's

- Run ~sudo make clean install~.

- Simply run using ~slock~.

- For something fancy may try slock -m "$(cowsay "$(fortune)" | lolcat -ft)".

*NOTE1:* This configuration of slock will not work if there is already a power management system running (such as xfce4-power-manager). The workaround would be to remove the [[https://tools.suckless.org/slock/patches/dpms][dpms patch]] which should not be difficult.

*Note2:* The suckless website suggests using [[https://linux.die.net/man/1/xautolock][xautolock]] for auto-locking. But I would suggest using [[https://github.com/jD91mZM2/xidlehook][xidlehook]] which is a better implementation as it has more options such as not to lock the screen when a full screen application is running or an audio is playing.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results silent :exports code
  #!/usr/bin/env zsh
  
  # Only exported variables can be used within the timer's command.
  export PRIMARY_DISPLAY="$(xrandr | awk '/ primary/{print $1}')"

  # Run xidlehook
  /usr/bin/xidlehook \
    `# Don't lock when there's a fullscreen application` \
    --not-when-fullscreen \
    `# Don't lock when there's audio playing` \
    --not-when-audio \
    `# Dim the screen after 60 seconds, undim if user becomes active` \
    --timer 90 \
      'xrandr --output "$PRIMARY_DISPLAY" --brightness .1' \
      'xrandr --output "$PRIMARY_DISPLAY" --brightness 1' \
  ` # Undim & lock after 10 more seconds` \
    --timer 30 \
      'xrandr --output "$PRIMARY_DISPLAY" --brightness 1; /usr/local/bin/slock' \
       '' 
#+END_SRC

*Cheers!*
